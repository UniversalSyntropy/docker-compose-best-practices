# Security Policy

## What counts as a security issue

This is a documentation repository, not a running service. Security issues here means:

- **Incorrect security advice** — a recommendation that would weaken a user's setup
- **Broken examples** — a Compose snippet or script that creates a vulnerability
- **Leaked credentials** — real passwords, tokens, or keys in examples or committed files

## Reporting

If you find a security issue, please
[open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/UniversalSyntropy/docker-compose-field-guide/issues)
with the label `security`.

For sensitive disclosures (e.g. a leaked credential), use
[GitHub's private security advisory](https://github.com/UniversalSyntropy/docker-compose-field-guide/security/advisories/new)
feature instead.

## Response

This is a community project maintained on a best-effort basis.
We aim to acknowledge reports within a few days and address
confirmed issues promptly.
